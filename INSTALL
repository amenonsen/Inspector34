Installation
------------

You need the following Perl modules:

  - POE (1.003 or later is known to work).

  - HTTP::Parser 0.04.

    At the time of writing, HTTP::Parser requires a small patch in order
    to work correctly. The patch is included here (proto.diff). To build
    the patched module, do the following:

    $ tar xf HTTP-Parser-0.04.tar.gz
    $ cd HTTP-Parser-0.04
    $ patch -p1 < ~/proto.diff

    Then "perl Makefile.PL" and "make install" as usual.

  - POE::Filter::HTTP::Parser (0.08 is known to work).

  - Date::Manip (5.54 is known to work).

These modules are all available from the CPAN. See
<http://search.cpan.org>

Just copy i34-record, i34-replay, and i34-diff somewhere into your path.
Nothing further is needed for installation.
