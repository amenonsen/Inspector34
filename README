Inspector34
-----------

Inspector34 is a transparent web proxy that records requests and
responses for later playback and comparison. It is meant to help
with regression testing.

It consists of three programs: i34-record is the proxy server, which
keeps a journal of HTTP requests and responses; and i34-replay recreates
the original requests from this journal. i34-diff compares the responses
from the original and replayed sessions.

Inspector34 is written in Perl, and depends on Rocco Caputo's excellent
POE framework, as well as the HTTP::Parser and POE::Filter::HTTP::Parser
modules. These are all available from the CPAN.

Inspector34 is distributed under a BSD-style open source license.
(See the included LICENSE file for details.)

The development of Inspector34 was sponsored by The Daily Source,
